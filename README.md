# Steam Auto-Wishlister

A Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script will automatically add a Steam game to your wishlist if it has cards. Perfect for knowing when such games are on sale.


## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) if you're using Firefox, or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) if you're using Chome. Steam Auto-Wishlister will not work without Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey.
2. After Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey are installed, visit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiveElementNinja/Steam-Auto-Wishlister/master/steam-auto-wishlister.user.js and it will prompt you to install the script.


## Usage

Once Steam Auto-Wishlister is installed, simply visit any game's store page. If it has cards, it will be added to your wishlist.

You will see a thin, gray outline around the `On Wishlist` wishlist button when a game has been auto-wishlisted, as seen below:

## Notes

* The [Steam Trading Cards](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category2=29) tag on Steam is a good place to find games that have cards.
* F2P games with cards will not be auto-added, because the only way to get cards for those games is to buy DLC or in-game content. They're also free, so there's no reason to wishlist them anyway.
* Over time, your wishlist will balloon in size once you start using this script. If you care about maintaining your wishlist, this script probably isn't for you. At the time of writing, mine has around 1700 items in it.

* **This script is auto-updating. You should only install auto-updating scripts from sources you trust. If you are not comfortable with that, don't install this script.**
